CSE 134B 2017fall HW4


Planning / Concerns / Explanations:



Roster part:

1. The biggest forseen upcoming changes would be storing the changes per user makes to the roster rather than only storing them per visit to
the site. Now since we are not using cloud or database to store data, changes made to the roster will disappear when user close the page -
even if the user is logged in validly. Next we would probably work on keep these changes consistent per user, so that it can best represent
the true user experience of using a web app.

2. This time for the concern of loading time and overall performance speed, we leave out the player photos part in the roster.
There are obvious trade-offs: pictures make it easier to recognize and remember the players, but they will very likely slow down the
loading speed in light of their size.



Schedule part:

1. This time for the concern of decreasing load time, we link the schedule part into a separate page. The trade-off is quite obvious:
it fails to keep style consistence between the app. But from the performance perspective it is acceptable to us.
