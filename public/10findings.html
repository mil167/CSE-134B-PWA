      <li><p> (Global) Translate doesn't work on any of the popular browsers today.</p></li>
      <li><p> (Text level) I was confused as to when we would ever use the ruby element. </p></li>
      <li><p> (Text level) code, samp, and kbd all look exactly the same. Is there any significant difference between the 3?</p></li>
      <li><p> (Forms) Using forms with php pages seems to be finicky. All of our php pages worked locally but didn't work when uploaded with firebase</p></li>
      <li><p> (Embedded content) In order to properly use the map and area tags on an image, I need to create a map with name="something" and then use usemap="#something" inside the img tag</p></li>
      <li><p> (Editing) Using an ins or del tag in the middle of a paragraph and continuing to the next paragraph without ending it won't continue the ins/del properly</p></li>
      <li><p> (Sections) Using a section or article tag instead of a div tag is a good way to use logical markup as well as use less classes in stylesheets</p></li>
      <li><p> (Embedded content) Video/audio content (as well as flash animations, etc) can be inserted with a variety of tags that give similar (but some sometimes slightly different) results</p></li>
      <li><p> (Links) When creating links to other pages, I'm confused about where to put the id of the reference page.</p></li>
      <li><p> (Scripts) When adding canvas to the page, I have to adjust the canvas to fit the picture. I'd like to know how to automatically fit the picture to the canvas instead.</p></li>
