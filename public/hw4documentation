CSE 134B 2017fall HW4


Planning / Concerns / Explanations:



Roster part:

1. The biggest forseen upcoming changes would be storing the changes per user makes to the roster rather than only storing them per visit to 
the site. Now since we are not using cloud or database to store data, changes made to the roster will disappear when user close the page - 
even if the user is logged in validly. Next we would probably work on keep these changes consistent per user, so that it can best represent 
the true user experience of using a web app.

2. This time for the concern of loading time and overall perfromance speed, we leave out the player photos part in the roster. 
There are obivious trade-offs: pictures make it easier to recognize and remember the players, but they will very likely slow down the 
loading speed in light of their size. 

3. Since we're more focused on building a mobile web page, here we kind of break the "1 page 1 url" rule. Users can roaming through different pages 
directly. The bad part is that if users hit the back button, they can't get the desired effect. But since normaly mobile web users don't really care
about which url (page) they are in, and since we always keep navigation bars at the bottom of every page, users should find their way back and forth
smoothly.




Schedule part:

1. This time for the concern of decreasing load time, we link the scheduel part into a seperate page. The trade-off is quite obivious: 
it fails to keep style consistence between the app. But from the performance perspective it is accepatble to us.
