ten findings
(global) translate doesn't work on any of the popular browsers today.
(text level) i was confused as to when we would ever use the ruby element. 
(text level) code samp and kbd all look exactly the same. is there any significant difference between the 3?
(forms) i was confused as to why there are so many states for input. why not just use text to replace some of them such as email, password, url, etc.?
(embedded content) in order to properly use the <map> and <area> tags on an image, I need to create a map with name=”something” and then use usemap=”#something” inside the img tag
